# roll20-faserip-character-sheet

This character sheet is a 'fork' of the Roll20 Marvel Superheroes character sheet from https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/MarvelSH. I didn't want to fork the entire repository so I've simply copied it here. 

For now, I am not opening a pull request to add or edit the current implementation of the sheet in Roll20. 

## Changes & new features:

* MSH terminology replaced with Faserip's, ranks for example.
* Fully functional rollers on Attributes and Powers. The rolled table will display the range you need to get Bronze, Silver, Gold results.
* Rollers also feature a prompt to "Buy in" with Karma - targeting Bronze, Silver, or Gold as supported by the rules.
* This version of the sheet has the "RIP" value inputs removed, though they are kept with the "FASE" section. I also removed the Karma "max" field.
* The values for ranks have been moved to the ranks themselves - this makes it more legible and usable, but some users may find they want those back. This supports how our group plays. 

## To-Do's:

* Modifiers for Attribute/Power rolls - benefits from boosts, specialties etc pre-roll. Still noodling on how best to do it.
* Re-work of Stunts tracking
* Enable "tick" tracking inline with Powers and Attributes
* Re-work of Limitations section
* Labeling of Flexibilities / Limitations
